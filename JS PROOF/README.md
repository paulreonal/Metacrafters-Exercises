# Project Create an NFT Collection

The provided code implements a simple system for managing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It defines a variable nfts to hold an array of NFT objects. This system demonstrates basic NFT management, including minting and listing NFTs and tracking the total supply.

## Description

The code creates a simple NFT management system using JavaScript. It starts by defining an empty array nfts to store NFT objects. The mintNFT function takes four parameters: name, artist, owner, and value, which it uses to create an NFT object. This object is then added to the nfts array. The listNFTs function loops through the nfts array, printing the metadata of each NFT, including its name, artist, owner, and value. This is done using console.log to provide a clear and structured output. The getTotalSupply function returns the number of NFTs that have been minted by returning the length of the nfts array. The code concludes by minting three example NFTs, listing them, and printing the total number of minted NFTs to the console, showcasing the functionality of the implemented system.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, I used Gitpod (https://www.gitpod.io/), but other IDE that has JavaScript extensions should be able to run it.

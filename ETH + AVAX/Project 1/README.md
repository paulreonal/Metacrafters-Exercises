# Project: Create a Token

This is a simple Solidity smart contract designed to showcase various Solidity programming features such as modifiers, and especially error handling with require(), assert(), and revert(). It includes functions for setting values, toggling contract activation status, and demonstrating error handling mechanisms.

## Description

This a Solidity smart contract that exemplifies best practices and key features of Solidity programming. It begins with a constructor to initialize contract state variables, including the contract owner (owner), a value holder (value), and a contract activation flag (active). Additionally, the contract demonstrates error handling mechanisms through functions like 'revertProto' and 'protoFunction'. The former uses revert() to handle an error condition in a view function, while the latter showcases a combination of require(), assert(), and conditional revert() for input validation and specific error handling.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Ethereum IDE, to run Solidity in a web browser. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then place the file, compile, then deploy.

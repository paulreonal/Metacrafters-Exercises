# Project: Create a Token

This Solidity contract implements a basic ERC20-like token named "DEGEN" (symbol: "DGN"). The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens, burn tokens, and transfer tokens between addresses. It also includes a redemption function where users can trade tokens for predefined game items.

## Description
This Solidity contract defines a basic cryptocurrency token called "DEGEN" with the symbol "DGN". It includes fundamental features typical of an ERC20-like token. The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens and increase the total supply. It also supports burning tokens, which reduces the total supply, and transferring tokens between addresses. Additionally, the contract includes a function that allows users to redeem tokens for game items by burning a specific amount of their tokens.

Overall, this project is aimed to deploy a transaction and to reflect in Avalanche.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Ethereum IDE, to run Solidity in a web browser. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then place the file, compile, then deploy.

To see the transaction, make sure to have AVAX in your account to have a successful transaction to be displayed in Avalanche.

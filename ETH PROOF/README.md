# Project: Create a Token

The AwesomeToken smart contract is designed to manage a custom cryptocurrency token with functionalities to mint and burn tokens. It includes public variables to store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply, ensuring transparency and easy access to these details.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In essence, the AwesomeToken contract initializes with predefined token details and sets the initial total supply to zero. It allows the contract owner to create new tokens through the mint function and reduce the total token supply through the burn function, with safeguards in place to prevent negative balances. This design ensures secure and efficient management of the token supply and user balances.
